## Markerbased AR
You must have a marker in front of your camera. It will then render an object on top of this marker.

## Markerless AR
Requires only a clean space (a surface plane) which will be recognized by your camera.

**Use cases:**
- Placing a coffee maker in your kitchen to see what it looks like
- Placing furniture in your room before you buy it to see what it looks like
- Pokemon Go
- Porsche app - Stell dir das Auto in die Einfahrt und 채ndere Aussehen und Farbe
- K체chenmanufaktur Sales App - Vertreter kommt mit Tablet zum Kunden, baut virtuell eine K체che auf und pr채sentiert

## Projection based AR
Requires a small projector for working, e.g. with Google GLASS.

## Superimposition based AR
Also called: Object tracking AR. It extends an actual object with a Digital object

## Target based AR
Recognizes a whole area of targets and places augmented objects according to their digital position

-> This might be a better option than using GPS based solutions when the area is rigid and seldom changes

**Use Cases**:
- BMW - Hotels - Tablet App: Quickest way to the pool or the bar
- Museum guide - a virtual, audio + AR based tour through the exponats

## GPS - based
The app recognizes the GPS coordinates of the device and places objects according to their programmed position
