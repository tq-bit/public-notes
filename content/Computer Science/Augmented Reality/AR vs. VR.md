## Compared to VR
VR allows the user to fully immerse into a virtual environment. Components built into either a smartphone or dedicated hardware, such as the Oculus Rift VR glasses help to measure motion and direction. Three core components here are
- Magnetometer ( like a compass )
- Accelerometer ( measures the changes in x, y and z axis of a phone / lens )
- Gyroscope Sensor ( measures very small changes in hardware position )

VR glasses must be supported by a high-level computing machine.
Both technologies require dedicated hardware to live up to their full potential
