Welcome to my digital garden. You can find a variety of notes here which I did not want to publish otherwisely on my blog, or just stuff that's been going through my mind.

Don't know where to start? Here are some pages which I might or might not randomly change as this site grows:

- [[Computer-Science/Hardware/Memory-management]]
- [[/DevOps/Git/Remote-repositories]]

This page was built using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). Give them a try if you work with Obsidian and would like to publish your notes.
